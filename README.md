# What can Llama tell me about my medical text descriptions?

We witness a wide range of applications for large language models (LLMs), and I'm curious about how an LLM would interpret my medical dataset.

I'm using the Pathology Visual Question Answering (Path-VQA) dataset from Hugging Face. I leverage its text descriptions as prompts for an LLM.

To enable this, I've built a local chat interface (chat.py) that interacts with Llama 3.1. Through this interface, I'm exploring how the model interprets a subset of the dataset's text descriptions and seeking inspiration for potential AI-model development.
